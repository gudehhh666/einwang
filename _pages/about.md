I am a Ph.D. student at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), concurrently engaged in a joint Ph.D. program at Zhongguancun Academy (ZGCA). I am supervised by Prof. [Xu-Yao Zhang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~xuyaozhang) and Prof. [Cheng-Lin Liu](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~liuchenglin), and my research lies at the intersection of **AI for Science (AI4S)** and **large language models (LLMs)**.

Rather than focusing on a specific scientific vertical, my interests center on methods to represent, retrieve, and leverage scientific knowledge and to enable automatic scientific discovery. Recently, I work on **factuality alignment of LLMs in scientific domains** and **automatic fact-checking pipelines**, under the guidance of and in close collaboration with Dr. [Yulong Chen](https://cylnlp.github.io/). During my internships, I have also explored **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **LLM Compression**.


Previously, I received a B.S. in Automation from Tianjin University, where I had the privilege of working with Prof. [Qinghao Meng](https://seea.tju.edu.cn/info/1013/1569.htm) and Dr. [Sheng Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QDaZ-eYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) on vision-based navigation.
